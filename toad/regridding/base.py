    """
    Abstract base class for spatial regridders in TOAD.

    Every regridder must provide:
      - regrid(): forward mapping from original grid to regridded coordinates
      - regrid_clusters_back(): inverse mapping from regridded labels to original grid
      - map_orig_to_regrid(): direct spatial index mapping without resampling

    The mapping method is lightweight and required for consensus-based workflows.
