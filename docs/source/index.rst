``toad`` (**T**\ ipping and **O**\ ther **A**\ brupt events **D**\ etector) is an open-source Python framework designed for detecting abrupt, nonlinear, and potentially irreversible transitions in gridded Earth-system data. Developed at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), TOAD provides a structured, user-friendly pipeline for:

1. Detecting abrupt shifts at the grid level
2. Clustering co-occurring changes in space and time
3. Synthesizing robust transition regions across ensemble members, variables, models, and detection methods

This modular workflow empowers researchers to systematically reveal where and when potentially tipping-relevant changes occur—supporting rigorous uncertainty quantification and coordinated risk assessments for critical Earth-system components.
