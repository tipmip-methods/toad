    "Asking ChatGPT what are usual ways to install python packages within the community, I received this list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pip (installing from PyPI)\n",
    "- conda\n",
    "- poetry\n",
    "- pipx (for applications, not packages)\n",
    "- pipenv (combines pip and virtualenv)\n",
    "- systems package manager (like `apt-get install [...]` or `brew install [...]`)\n",
    "- manual setup (e.g. `git clone [repo url]` > `python setup.py install`)\n",
    "- Docker Containers (isolates entire application)\n",
    "- Cloud-Based Package Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "I also stumbled over `*.toml` files. Seems to be the state-of-the-art way of providing meta data for installing a package. ChatGPT says a `pyproject.toml` file is the 'modern and recommended way to configure Python packages'. Looking at numpy and xarray repo, we can find this file. Numpy has no `setup.py` at all and xarray only uses it to referr to the the git meta data fot the version (seems depricated to me).\n",
    "\n",
    "My intuition says, we should focus on installability with `pip`, `conda`, `poetry` and `Docker` (replaced by `Container`). Apparently they are compatible with `*.toml` files. Not exactly sure yet about how private all of these methods are, `Container` definelty has the option. Will look into the other methods too, eventually.\n"
